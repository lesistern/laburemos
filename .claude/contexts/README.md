## Usage

These context files can be used in several ways:

1. **As slash commands**: Copy relevant files to `.claude/commands/` to use as slash commands
2. **As reference**: Read these files to understand best practices for Claude Code
3. **As templates**: Use these as starting points for your own workflows
4. **For context priming**: Use the context_prime workflows to set up Claude with project context

## Quick Start

To use a workflow as a slash command:
```bash
cp workflows/context_prime.md ../.claude/commands/prime.md
```

Then in Claude Code, you can use:
```
/prime
```
