## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create CI/CD IAM User
```bash
# Create IAM user
aws iam create-user --user-name laburemos-ci-user

# Attach PowerUser policy (or create custom policy with minimal permissions)
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name laburemos-ci-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess

# Create access keys
aws iam create-access-key --user-name laburemos-ci-user
```
- [ ] IAM user created
- [ ] Access keys generated and added to GitHub secrets
- [ ] User has required permissions

### Step 2: SSL Certificate (Production)
```bash
# Request certificate in us-east-1 (required for CloudFront)
aws acm request-certificate \
  --domain-name your-domain.com \
  --subject-alternative-names www.your-domain.com \
  --validation-method DNS \
  --region us-east-1
```
- [ ] SSL certificate requested
- [ ] DNS validation completed
- [ ] Certificate ARN added to GitHub secrets

### Step 3: Configure External Services

#### SonarCloud Setup
1. [ ] Go to https://sonarcloud.io/
2. [ ] Sign up with GitHub account
3. [ ] Import your repository
4. [ ] Get organization key and project key
5. [ ] Generate token and add to GitHub secrets

#### Snyk Setup
1. [ ] Go to https://snyk.io/
2. [ ] Sign up with GitHub account
3. [ ] Connect your repository
4. [ ] Generate API token
5. [ ] Add token to GitHub secrets

#### Slack Integration
1. [ ] Create Slack webhook URL
2. [ ] Add webhook URL to GitHub secrets
3. [ ] Test notification (optional)

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### First Deployment - Staging

- [ ] Push code to `develop` branch
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflow starts
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress in Actions tab
- [ ] Check AWS CloudFormation stack creation
- [ ] Verify staging application is accessible
- [ ] Run smoke tests on staging environment

### First Deployment - Production

- [ ] Merge `develop` to `main` branch
- [ ] Push `main` branch
- [ ] Monitor production deployment
- [ ] Verify production application is accessible
- [ ] Configure domain DNS (if using custom domain)
- [ ] Test all critical user flows

---

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

### Infrastructure Verification
- [ ] CloudFormation stacks deployed successfully
- [ ] ECS services running and healthy
- [ ] RDS instances accessible and healthy
- [ ] ElastiCache cluster operational
- [ ] Load balancers responding
- [ ] S3 buckets created with proper permissions
- [ ] CloudFront distributions active

### Application Verification
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Backend API responds to health checks
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Redis caching functional

---

## üîß Configuration Updates

### Update Environment Variables
After infrastructure deployment, update these secrets with actual values:

```bash
# Get RDS endpoints from CloudFormation outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name laburemos-staging \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'

aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name laburemos-production \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```
